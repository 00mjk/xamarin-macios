TODO:
	Add support for CFXXXXGetTypeID?
	Do we need to implement Retain in some form?

DONE:
	CGAffineTransform.cs
	CGColor.cs
	CGGeometry.cs
	CGGradient.cs
	CGContext.cs
		Missing stuff that uses CFDictionary
		Missing DrawShading, because of CGShading missing
	CGPath.cs	
		Apply function is broken, since the compiler refuses to compile a switch.
	CGPattern.cs

Mostly done:
	CGColorSpace.cs
		Missing a few constructors for some color spaces, but not very useful in general.
		Needs testing for the array constructors, and probably guards/validation
	CGFont.cs
		Missing string references (kCGFontVariationAxisName, etc)
		Missing CreateWithDataProvider impl, need CGDataProvider impl
		Missing CreateCopyWithVariations
		Missing a few more due to various CF* types not existing yet

Basic foundation (IDisposable), needs work:
	CGPDFPage.cs
